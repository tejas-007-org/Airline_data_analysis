# Airline Ticket Booking and Revenue Analysis

This repository contains an **Airline Ticket Booking and Revenue Analysis** project focused on understanding booking trends, aircraft occupancy, and pricing strategies to improve airline profitability. The analysis is documented in the `Airline-Analysis-Report.docx` file.[1]

## Project Overview

The project analyzes airline ticket bookings and revenue over a period from June to August 2017 using visualization and summary statistics. It aims to identify patterns in demand, occupancy, and fare structures to support data‑driven business decisions.[1]

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:[1]

- Increase occupancy rate to improve profit per seat.
- Improve pricing strategy based on market conditions and customer preferences.
- Enhance customer experience across the booking journey.
- Identify opportunities to optimize low-performing flights.

## Key Analyses and Insights

- **Ticket Booking Trends**:  
  - Growth phase from June 22 to July 7 with rising demand.  
  - Stabilization from July 8 to mid‑August with relatively consistent bookings.  
  - Peak bookings in early‑to‑mid July, followed by a decline in mid‑August.[1]

- **Aircraft Fleet Analysis**:  
  - Focus on aircraft with more than 100 seats, ranging from 116 to 402 seats.  
  - The 773 aircraft has the largest capacity and is critical for revenue optimization.[1]

- **Fare Conditions and Classes**:  
  - Business class fares are consistently higher than economy across aircraft.  
  - Comfort class is available only on aircraft 773; CN1 and CR2 offer only economy class.[1]

- **Occupancy Rate Analysis**:  
  - Aircraft 773 and 733 show the highest occupancy (around 65.9% and 61.73%).  
  - Aircraft 319 and CR2 have lower occupancy (around 46.19% and 42.97%), indicating improvement opportunities.[1]

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the report suggests several strategies to improve performance:[1]

- Adjust **pricing strategy** using dynamic pricing during peak and off‑peak periods.  
- Perform **route optimization** to align aircraft with routes that match demand.  
- Increase **marketing focus** and promotional campaigns for low‑occupancy flights.  
- **Adjust schedules** to better match customer travel patterns.  
- Use occupancy analysis as a basis for **revenue impact simulations** (e.g., effect of a 10% occupancy increase).

## Files in This Repository

- `Airline-Analysis-Report.docx`: Detailed report containing business context, visualizations, tables, and findings.[1]
- (Optional) `notebooks/` or `scripts/`: Add your Jupyter notebooks or scripts here if you implement the analysis in code.
- `README.md`: Project overview, objectives, insights, and usage information.

## How to Use This Project

- Open `Airline-Analysis-Report.docx` to read the full business and analytical report.[1]
- Use the report as:
  - A portfolio project to showcase data analysis, visualization, and business insight skills.
  - A reference for building dashboards on airline KPIs like bookings, revenue, and occupancy.
  - A base for implementing the same analysis in Python, SQL, or BI tools.

## Future Improvements

Potential extensions to this project include:[1]

- Implementing the analysis in Python or SQL and adding reproducible code.
- Building interactive dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio).
- Exploring predictive models for demand and dynamic pricing.
- Adding more time periods or additional airlines for comparative analysis.
